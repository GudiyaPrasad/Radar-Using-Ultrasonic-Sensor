# Radar-Using-Ultrasonic-Sensor
The aim of this project is to calculate the distance position and speed of the object placed at some distance from the sensor. Ultrasonic sensor sends the ultrasonic wave in different directions by rotating with help of servo motor. This wave travels in air and gets reflected back after striking some object.
